<div class="span6">
<h1>Dang!</h1>

<p>Something went wrong.  Probably one of:</p>
        <ol><li>You can't type very well</li>
        <li>We can't program properly</li>
        <li>There is a problem with the intertubes</li></ol>

<p>Try again.  If it keeps happening and you can access other internet sites OK then it is probably our problem.
If that is the case <em><strong>please</strong></em> let us know.  That way we can fix it and hopefully we won't waste
your time again.</p>
