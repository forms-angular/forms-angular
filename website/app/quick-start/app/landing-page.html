<div class="row">

        <p>In this really simple set-up there are a few routes for each model (and if you have followed the quick-start you will
            have a model called <strong>applicant</strong> so the first two links will work).</p>
        <p>The routes are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/#/applicant">/#/:model</a> which lists the documents in the collection, with links to the form for editing them.</li>
            <li><a href="/#/applicant/new">/#/:model/new</a> which enables the user to create a new document using the default form for the collection.</li>
            <li>/#/:model/:id/edit which enables the user to edit a document</li>
        </ul>
        <p>TYou might also want to try the search box in the navbar (once you have added some data).</p>
        <p>There is a lot more you can do with forms-angular - for more information visit the <a href="//www.forms-angular.org">forms-angular website</a></p>
