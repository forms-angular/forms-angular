<p>Forms angular comes with a small number of built-in forms that can be used to meet a vast number of requirements.  They all use RESTful routes
    and handle querying and updating the server.  Alternatively you can build your own forms using the directives provided by forms-angular.</p>

<section id="styling" name="Styling" affix-scroll><h3>Styling</h3>
    <p><strong>forms-angular</strong> uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to lay out the forms.
    Mostly due to historical accident, versions <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2">2.3.2</a>
    and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">3.3.5</a> are supported by forms-angular (though only the latter is
    supported by the maintainers of Twitter bootstrap).  By default
    2.3.2 compliant markup is generated - you can switch to 3.3.5 by configuring the library as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>formsAngular.config(['cssFrameworkServiceProvider', function (cssFrameworkService) {
  cssFrameworkService.setOptions({framework: 'bs3'});
}]);</code></pre>

</section>
<section id="routes" name="Routes" affix-scroll><h3>Routes</h3>
    <p>For each model the following routes are supported:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>/#/:model</strong> which lists the documents in the collection, with links to the form for editing them</li>
        <li><strong>/#/:model/new</strong> which enables the user to create a new document using the default form for the collection.  It is also possible to override the
        default values for new records passing the desired record as follows: <code>/#/:model/new?r={"field1":"value1","field2":"value2"}</code></li>
        <li><strong>/#/:model/:id/edit</strong> which enables the user to edit a document</li>
        <li><strong>/#/:model/:id/edit/:tab</strong> which enables the user to edit a document, opening a tabbed form at a specified tab</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These routes are set up by making a call such as:<pre><code>myDemoApp.config(['formRoutesProvider', function (formRoutes) {
  formRoutes.start({
    routing: 'ngroute',
    fixedRoutes: [
      {route:'/index', options:{templateUrl: 'partials/landing-page.html'}},
      {route:'/get-started', options:{templateUrl: 'partials/get-started.html'}},
      {route: '/a-model/new', options: {templateUrl: 'partials/custom-new.html'}},            // example view override
      {route: '/a-model/:id/edit', options: {templateUrl: 'partials/custom-edit.html'}},      // example view override
    ]
  }]);</code></pre>which specifies that we are using ngRoute for our routing (ui-router is also supported) and declares
  several routes explicitly, two of which over-ride the built-in routes for <strong>a-model</strong>.</p>

  <p>For registered models other than a-model, and for the other a-model routes the system creates routes automatically and use built-in
  templates - see details in the <a href="{{ buildUrl('forms#input-form') }} ">Input Form</a> and
  <a href="{{ buildUrl('forms#listing-form') }} ">Listing form</a>.</p>

  The built-in templates can be over-ridden by creating your own templates and adding a <code>templateFolder</code> property
    to the object passed to <code>formRoutes.start()</code>.  The
    <a href="https://github.com/forms-angular/forms-angular/blob/master/template/base-edit.html"><code>base-edit.html</code></a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/forms-angular/forms-angular/blob/master/template/base-list.html"><code>base-list.html</code></a> both need
    to be overridden (as does the
    <a href="https://github.com/forms-angular/forms-angular/blob/master/template/base-analysis.html"><code>base-analysis.html</code></a>
    if the <a href="{{ buildUrl('plugins#reports')}}">fng-reports plugin</a> is used).</p>

    <p>If you prefer HTML5Mode (which gives routes without the /#) then you can also use the<code><pre>
  html5Mode: true,
  hashPrefix: '!'
</code></pre> properties.</p>
<p>if you are using HTML5Mode ensure that your index.html file has<pre><code>&lt;base href="/"&gt;</code></pre>
    in the header.</p>
<p>Whatever options are used, forms-angular will create the correct routes using <pre><code>urlService.buildUrl(path)</code></pre>
    which will add in hashes and prefixes to the path as required.  This service can be used in your application so that
you can easily switch between modes without having to manually change all the internal links.</p>
</section>

<section id="input-form" name="Input Form" affix-scroll>
<h3>Input Form</h3>
<p>The <strong>form-input</strong> directive expands the schema into nice looking
    data capture form, but that is only a small part of the story.
    The <a href="https://github.com/forms-angular/forms-angular/blob/master/template/base-edit.html">
    built-in edit form</a> also gives you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Header section showing the key fields from the record.</li>
    <li><p>Buttons to perform the usual Save, Cancel, New and Delete operations.  forms-angular handles all
        the back-end stuff for you.  There a number of keyboard short cuts that can be used in the forms. Hit <span class="key">?</span> to find out more.</p>
        <p>The form button customisation is currently limited to over-riding the default enabled state of the buttons by
            defining
            functions in a controller for the model (or model and form). See <a href="/scripts/controllers/d-array-example.js">here</a> for an
            example.</p></li>
    <li>Error message section, which displays error messages when (for example) some server-side validation fails when updating something.</li>
</ul>
  <p>You can specify an alternative edit form for an individual model or override all built-in models as shown in the <a href="{{ buildUrl('forms#routes')}}">Routes</a> section above.</p>
</section>

<section id="listing" name="Listing Form" affix-scroll>
<h3>Listing Form</h3>

<p>The listing routes (of the format <strong>/#/:model</strong>) are used to build a page
    containing a list of documents in the collection, showing the <a ng-href="{{buildUrl('schemas#list-fields')}}">list fields</a>.  You can
    specify a sort order by adding a <strong>listOrder</strong> value to the model as shown in <a href="/models/g_conditional_field.js">this</a> model.
    Alternatively you can specify a sort order at run-time using the o parameter as in <a ng-href="{{buildUrl('f_nested_schema?o=%7B%22forename%22:1%7D')}}">this</a> example.
</p>

<p>Listing routes support filters, such as</p>

<a ng-href="{{buildUrl('b_enhanced_schema?f=%7B%22surname%22:%22Smith%22%7D')}}">
    <pre>/#/b_enhanced_schema?f={"surname":"Smith"}</pre>
</a>

<p>and calls to the aggregation framework, provided they project to an array of docs that contains an _id property
    which is used
    to select from the model. For example the (rather unpalatable)</p>
<a ng-href="{{buildUrl('f_nested_schema?a=%5B%7B%22%24unwind%22%3A%22%24exams%22%7D%2C%7B%22%24sort%22%3A%7B%22exams.score%22%3A1%7D%7D%2C%7B%22%24group%22%3A%7B%22_id%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22%24_id%22%7D%2C%22bestSubject%22%3A%7B%22%24last%22%3A%22%24exams.subject%22%7D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22%24match%22%3A%7B%22bestSubject%22%3A%22English%22%7D%7D%2C%7B%22%24project%22%3A%7B%22_id%22%3A%22%24_id.id%22%7D%7D%5D')}}">
    <pre>/#/f_nested_schema?a=[{"$unwind":"$exams"},{"$sort":{"exams.score":1}},{"$group":{"_id":{"id":"$_id"},"bestSubject":{"$last":"$exams.subject"}}},{"$match":{"bestSubject":"English"}},{"$project":{"_id":"$_id.id"}}]</pre>
</a>

<p>selects all students who did better in their English exam than any other subject. To find out how to use the
    aggregation framework refer to the <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation/">MongoDB docs</a>.
</p>

<p>These can be combined (though there appears to be a problem unless the filter precedes the aggregation).</p>

<p>By default the list order is the MongoDB natural order. The default list order for a table can be set by
    specifying a <strong>listOrder</strong> option in the model definition (see <a href="/models/g_conditional_field.js">g_conditional_field</a> for an example).</p>
</section>
<section id="search" name="Search" affix-scroll>
    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>The smallest form is the search form, in the navbar at the top of this page. It is implemented as a directive - <strong>global-search</strong>.
        When you enter text into it the controller makes a call to the server which looks for matching data by searching the indexed
        fields in each model for values starting with the search string.</p>

    <p>There are a number of options that can be added to model exports to modify the search behaviour. Examples can be
        found
        in the model definitions files for <a href="/models/f_nested_schema.js">f_nested_schema</a> and <a href="/models/g_conditional_field.js">g_conditional_field</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>searchImportance</strong> can be <strong>false</strong> (which suppresses the model from appearing in general search results - ie searches with no model specified)
            or a value from 0 to 99 (default) that can be used to determine the order
            of table searches. There is an example in <a href="/models/g_conditional_field.js">this</a> model.
        </li>
        <li><strong>searchOrder</strong> can be used to set the default ordering of the search results within a model.
            There is an example in <a href="/models/g_conditional_field.js">this</a> model.
            It is normally used in conjunction with searchImportance.
        </li>
        <li><strong>searchResultFormat</strong> allows fine control of the display of search results. It points to a
            function which returns an object which must contain the following:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>resource</strong> the model name (or model/customForm) that the search result will link to</li>
                <li><strong>resourceText</strong> the display name for the resource</li>
                <li><strong>id</strong> the id to link to</li>
                <li><strong>weighting</strong> is a value from 0 to 9999 (default) that specifies the sort ordering</li>
                <li><strong>text</strong> the display text for the item</li>
            </ul>
            and may additionally contain
          <ul>
            <li><strong>resourceTab</strong> the tab within the target form that should be added to the URLe</li>
            <li><strong>additional</strong> additional display text for the item (used as a pop-up when present)</li>
          </ul>
            Both the resource, resourceText and resourceTab can be localised by a line of code like
            <pre><code>DataFormHandler.getResource('person').options.localisationData = [{from: 'person/customer', to: 'person/client', context: 'resource'},{from:'Customer', to:'Client', context: 'resourceText'}];</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>

    A truthy <strong>noSearch</strong> key means index on a schema type is not used in the searchBox searches.
    A use case for this would be an index that is used in reports for grouping which has no meaning in a search.

    The top 10 search results appear below the search form, where the ordering is by a string built up as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>One digit 'hit weighting' where a record that has matched one string in the search query scores 9,
            a record that has had two matches scores 8 etc.</li>
        <li>Two digit searchImportance</li>
        <li>Four digit weighting</li>
        <li>The display text</li>
    </ul>
</section>


<section id="form-input-directive" name="form-input Directive" affix-scroll>
    <h3>The form-input Directive</h3>

    <p>The form-input directive, which is the core component of forms-angular, takes one mandatory attribute - schema -
        which is documented at the top of the <a ng-href="{{buildUrl('schemas')}}">page</a> and some optional attributes.</p>

    <p>The optional attributes that can be passed for form-input are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>formstyle</strong> this attribute can take the values <strong>vertical</strong>, <strong>horizontal</strong>,
            <strong>inline</strong> and <strong>horizontalCompact</strong>.  The first three generate the markup for a Twitter Bootstrap style and the last slightly modified style. <strong>vertical</strong>
            generates markup that works with the default form style, and the others need classes adding as follows:
          <br />
          <br />
            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <tbody>

                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          <table class="table table-bordered">

        <li><strong>name</strong> the name to be given to the form</li>
        <li><strong>forceform</strong> can be set to true to force the generation of the <strong>form</strong>
            attribute under circumstances where it would generally not be generated (generally if a model attribute is used)</li>
        <li><strong>noautofocus</strong> can be set to true if you don't want the first field to receive focus</li>
        <!--TODO complete this list            -->
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="client-side-customisation" name="Client Side Customization" affix-scroll>
    <h3>Client Side Customization</h3>

    <p>Additional functionality can be added by using "model controllers" which have the name of
        a model followed by <strong>Ctrl</strong> (or the name of the model followed by the name of
        the custom form followed by Ctrl. There is an sample model controller <a href="/scripts/controllers/b_enhanced_schema.js">here</a>
        which is used in the examples in this section. The NavCtrl controller handles the model controllers, so don't remove
        it.  There are two points during the creation of a form when the model controllers are called:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>When the BaseCtrl scope is available.</strong> Sometimes it is useful to have model controllers access the base controller, which is created after them.  The best way to
    do this is to add a <em>$scope.onBaseCtrlReady = function (baseScope)</em> to the model controller.</li>
        <li><strong>When the form is generated and the data is available.</strong> This allows the model controllers to modify the form in ways that
          depend on the value of the data.  This is done by adding a <em>$scope.onAllReady = function (baseScope)</em> to the model controller.</li>
      </ol>

    <h5 id="naming">Naming</h5>
    <p>The BaseCtrl scope has a variable called <strong>modelNameDisplay</strong> which is used in several places in the
        demo app. It defaults to the model name in title case, but can be over-ridden in the model controller.</p>

    <h5>Menu</h5>

    <p>The <b><model-controller-dropdown /></b> directive can be added to a <b>ul.navbar-nav</b> to add a dynamic dropdown menu
        populated by the model controllers (see an example <a ng-href="{{buildUrl('b_enhanced_schema')}}">here</a>)
        The options can be configured to appear when records are being listed, edited or created. The top level text is
        taken from the model controller's <strong>dropDownDisplay</strong> variable, if present. If not present it will
        fall back to the modelNameDisplay (see above) and if that is not present the model name.</p>

    <p>Sometimes menu options only apply to a subset of records in a collection.  In this case they can be hidden by
        specifying an <strong>isHidden($index)</strong> function or disabled using an <strong>isDisabled($index)</strong>
        function.  For example to hide the option when a field has a certain value:</p>

        <pre><code>$scope.contextMenu = [{
  text: 'Do something',
  fn : function() {// some code},
  isHidden: function() {
    return $scope.record._id ? $scope.record.field === 'value' : true;
  },
    ...
}];</code></pre>

    <p>A divider can be added to a menu:</p>
        <pre><code>$scope.contextMenu = [{
  divider: true
  },
  ...
}];</code></pre>

    <h5 id="postprocessing">Post form-input generation processing</h5>

    <p>The form-input directive broadcasts a <strong>formInputDone</strong> message when it has
        processed a control. This can be acted on by the model controller. In our <a ng-href="{{buildUrl('b_enhanced_schema/new')}}">example</a> we
        add a change handler to a select2 control which changes background color of a control group
        when the eye colour is changed.  Try it, and then see how it is done at the bottom of
        <a href="/scripts/controllers/b_enhanced_schema.js">this</a> controller.</p>

    <h5>Client side data events</h5>

    <p>There are hooks before and after CRUD events as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>onInitialiseNewRecord function(data) - called as the new object is instantiated on the client after any application of the r query parameter (see <a href="/#/forms#routes">new route</a> above)</li>
      <li>onBeforeRead function(id, callback(err))</li>
      <li>onAfterRead function(data)</li>
      <li>onBeforeCreate function(data, callback(err)) - called before a new record is added to the collection</li>
      <li>onAfterCreate function(data)</li>
      <li>onBeforeUpdate function(data, old, callback(err))</li>
      <li>onAfterUpdate function(data, old)</li>
      <li>onBeforeDelete function(old, callback(err))</li>
      <li>onAfterDelete function(old)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In all onBefore... cases passing an error back will stop the event completing. There is a trivial example of
      how a data event hook might be used in <a href="/scripts/controllers/d-array-example.js">this</a> controller, which shows
      how such event handlers are set up.  In the case of the onBeforeCreate or onBeforeUpdate events the update/create
      can be handled within the function by passing back the special err of '_update_handled_'.  In these cases it will
      usually be helpful to call <code>baseScope.prepareForSave(cb: (error: string, dataToSave?: any) => void): void</code>
      to convert the client-side model into the format that needs to be written back to MongoDb.
    </p>

    <p>You can also call onRecordChange function(data, old) which is useful for updating calculated fields etc.</p>

    <h5>Adding additional attributes to all elements.</h5>
    <p>It is possible to apply additional attributes to all elements of a certain type by passing it once in the form-input declaration. The available types are Control Group, Field or Label.</p>
    <p>This can be achieved in two ways. Either as an attribute of the form-input element:</p>
    <pre>&lt;form-input schema="formSchema" <span>add-all-group="injected-element='with parameters'"</span>&gt;</pre>
    <p>or via the controller by making it an attribute of scope: <pre><span>$scope.addAllGroup="injected-attribute"</span></pre></p>
    <p>The three versions of this are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>add-all-group="injected-attribute"</li>
        <li>add-all-field="injected-attribute"</li>
        <li>add-all-label="injected-attribute"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example if wished to inject a directive called 'hide-on-empty' to every individual control group then you would add:</p>
    <pre>add-all-group="hide-on-empty"</pre>
    <p>to the form-input declaration.</p>
    <p>If declared in a controller then it will be applied to all child controllers. If declared in the form-input element
        the scope is limited to the individual form's scope. In this way a single declaration at the root scope is seem by all controllers.</p>
    <p>Due to the parse method, in order declare multiple classes each class must be prefixed with 'class=' e.g.</p>
    <pre>&lt;form-input schema="formSchema" <span>add-all-group="injected-element='with parameters' class=myclass class=my-second-class"</span>&gt;</pre>

</section>

<section id="server-side-customisation" name="Server Side Customization" affix-scroll>
    <h3>Server Side Customization</h3>

    <h5>Server side data events</h5>

    <p>On the server side there are hooks around data events as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>findFunc function(req, callback(err, query)) applies a filter to records returned by the server. A common
          use case is to restrict a user to only see their own records.
      </li>
      <li>onSave function(doc, req, callback(err)) is a pre save hook that allows access to the record and the
          environment. A common use case is to apply 'fine-grain' authentication, or to add additional pseudo-fields (such as user)
          to the document for use with the audit plugin.
      </li>
