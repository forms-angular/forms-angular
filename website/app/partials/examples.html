        <p>Below there are several examples of forms and customisations, some of which are linked to from other parts of the documentation.  In each case you can view the schema, create a new document or list the collection (and drill down to existing documents).  Together they should give a good idea of some of the basic things you can do with forms-angular.</p>
        <p>There are a number of keyboard short cuts that can be used in the forms.  Hit <span class="key">?</span> to find out more.</p>
